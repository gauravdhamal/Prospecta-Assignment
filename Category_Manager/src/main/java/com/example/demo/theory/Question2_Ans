Question:
Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.
 
A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3
 
This can be represented in an excel sheet below:

A B C

1 5 3 =5+A1

2 7 8 =A2+B2

3 9 =4+5 =C2+B3
 
I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output
 with the results.  If it is a value, then return a value.  
 If it is a formula then calculate the formula and return the value of that formula.

Answers:

1. How will you tackle the challenge above?
To solve any problem I will first of all divide the problem into sub-problem and then I will solve that sub-problems first.

Below steps I will follow.

Step1: I will create a filename.csv file to store the data.

Step2: Then I will put all the whole input data inside a String.

Step3: As CSV full form is Comma Separated Value. So first of all I will split that String by "," which will provide me array of Strings.

Step4: Then, After that I will create one Map of Map<String,String>

Step5: After creating Map I will again split each String by ":" which will provide me String array of size 2.

Step6: Then I will insert that String inside map before ":" value as a Key and after ":" value as a Value.

Step7: After putting all inside Map then I can check weather map contains all values by using Character class.

Step8: If my map contains any formula then I will calculate that answer and again store the answer in another Map which I will create as Map<String,Integer>.

Step9: Then finally after doing all the operation my Map<String,Integer> contains all the result data Key as cell information and Value as a result for that cell.


2. What type of errors you would you check for?
Some basics error I need to check as below:
Input might be null/empty String.
While parsing the data I might get parsing Error.
In some cases I might get Integer overflow error if our input Integer values are so big. 

3. How might a user break your code?
As I have taken care of all parameters like invalid input and all.
Still user can break my code by changing file type.
Also If file contains some long data then I might get Integer overflow.
